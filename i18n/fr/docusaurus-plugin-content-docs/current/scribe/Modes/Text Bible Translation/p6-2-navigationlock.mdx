<h3> In this version, this function is not available </h3> 

- Click on the lock icon <img src="/autographaAssetsV2/how-to/lock.png" width="30px" alt=""/> on the top-right corner of the **Editor column.** 
- By locking the editor column, the resource columns will follow the same reference that the editing column is currently on. So clicking on different verses in the editing column would update the resource panes accordingly.
- By unlocking the editor column, the resource columns will remain on the last verse the user clicked on before unlocking. This also allows the user to independently explore separate references in the resource sections.
