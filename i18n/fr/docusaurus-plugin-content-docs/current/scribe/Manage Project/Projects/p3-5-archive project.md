**Scribe** discourages deletion to prevent any inadvertent data loss. As an alternative, it allows users to Archive projects which would not show up in the main listing of projects anymore. Archived projects maybe restored at any point. Though discouraged, power users may delete archived projects completely from the disk location outside the application. Backups of the archived projects are maintained by **scribe**.

**Steps to archive the project**
- Select a project from the list to **Archive**
- Click the downward pointing arrow to see a dropdown menu with the project description
- Click on the three dots menu with options
   - Edit 
   - Export
   - Archive
- Select the **Archive** to save the project for future reference

**Steps to restore the Archived project**

- Click the Archived button in the top right corner
- The archived files list appears
- Choose the Project you want to activate
- Then, select **Restore** by pressing the downward pointing arrow

The Archive appears in the Sidebar once you archive at least one note. Notes in the Archive do not appear in search results elsewhere, but you can select the Archive section and search its notes.
If you have, archived notes will sync between your devices.
