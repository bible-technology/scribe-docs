This is the right-most column on the screen, which has a black outline. Once you click a text translation project name from the projects listing, you will be taken to the Text Translation Mode. This mode supports drafting and editing a Bible translation. This is where the user is expected to make edits or draft new text. However, the user may add new columns for loading reference material during the translation process.
