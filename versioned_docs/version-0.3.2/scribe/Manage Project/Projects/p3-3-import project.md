Scribe provides users with the functionality to import [Scripture Burrito](https://docs.burrito.bible/) validated projects directly from the local devices.

**Steps to Import a Project**

- On the project page, click on the **Import** button located at the top right side

- Select a folder from local device using the dialogue box that displays.

- Choose the desired folder for import and click on Select Folder

- The dialogue box will display project details, including the Scripture Burrito directory, Project and language name, and project type. You will also see a message confirming the successful validation of the Burrito with the green tick mark, as Scribe only permits the import of Scripture Burrito files.

- Click Import to proceed.

- On a successful project import, a pop-up message will appear at the bottom left side, indicating that the project has been successfully imported.

- If the project already exists, a verification message will appear, asking whether you want to replace the existing project file. If you wish to overwrite the file, click on "Replace."

Note: Scribe allows to import and export USFM (Unified Standard Format Markers) files and MD files. It also supports TSV resources in OBS Translation Notes
