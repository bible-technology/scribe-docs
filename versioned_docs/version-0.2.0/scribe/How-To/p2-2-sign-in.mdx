<h2>Sign in function </h2> 

Scribe enables multiple users on the same computer to use the same application while maintaining separate project data.
It can be difficult to locate the project and user name when multiple users are using the same computer.
To assist with this, there is a "View More" option on the "Sign In" page. This feature allows users to choose between active and inactive user names.

**Steps**: 
- Click on the “View More” button, 
- There are two options on the page. "Active"  and "Archived"
- The list of user names is displayed in the Active section.
- You can archive the user by selecting the user name and clicking the delete button.
- The chosen user name will be archived.

**To restore the archived user name,**
- Click on view more.
- Select the Archive tab.
- A list of archived user names appears.
- Next to the user name, click the update icon.
- The selected user name appears in the active list.
