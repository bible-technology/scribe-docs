**Scribe** provides users with the functionality to import [Scripture Burrito](https://docs.burrito.bible/) validated projects directly from the local devices.

**Steps to Import a Project**

- On the project page, click on the **Import** button located at the top right side
- Select a folder from local device using the dialogue box that displays
- Choose the desired folder for import and click on **Select Folder**
- The dialogue box will display project details, including the Scripture Burrito directory, Project and language name, and project type
- You will also see a message confirming the successful validation of the Burrito with the green tick mark, as Scribe only permits the import of Scripture Burrito files
- Click **Import** to proceed
- On a successful project import, a pop-up message will appear at the bottom left side, indicating that the project has been successfully imported
- If the project already exists, a verification message will appear, asking whether you want to replace the existing project file. If you wish to overwrite the file, click on **Replace**

Note: **Scribe** allows to **Import** and **Export** USFM (Unified Standard Format Markers) files and MD files. It also supports TSV resources in OBS Translation Notes
