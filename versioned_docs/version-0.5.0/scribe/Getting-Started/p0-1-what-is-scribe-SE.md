**Scribe SE** supports different flavours such as Bible Translation, Open Bible Stories (OBS) and Oral Bible Translation (Audio). Bible translations from the source text can be drafted and edited with the help of **Scribe**. Additionally, it allows translators to import and export [Scripture Burrito](https://docs.burrito.bible/) format, it also allows importing USFM files from the local system. Users can work on multiple projects simultaneously.
